<h2> Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network.  </h2>
Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. <b> Cycle-Consistent  Adversarial Network </b> is an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples.
